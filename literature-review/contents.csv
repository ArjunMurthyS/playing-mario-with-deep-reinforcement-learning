Title,TL;DR,Domain
Deep Neuroevolution: Genetic Algorithms are a Competetive Alternative for Training Deep Neural Networks for Reinforcement Learning,"They use a SGA to optimize weights of DNN on Atari DRL benchmarks. Other ES, GA algorithms are open to exploration",Atari
Improving Exploration in Evolution Strategies for Deep Reinforcement Learning via a Population of Novelty-Seeking Agents,They hyrbidize Novelty Search (NS) algorithms and Quality Diversity (QD) algorithms with ES to improve it's exploration in sparse or deceptive domains,"Atari, Humanoid Locomotion"
On the Relationship Between the OpenAI Evolution Strategy and Stochastic Gradient Descent,"They explore the correlation of ES and SGD on the MNIST dataset to provide an understanding of their previous results in RL. They find that ES outperforms standard SGD, but is unnecessary in cases (most supervised learning) where immediate gradients are available.",MNIST
Evolving Deep Neural Networks,"They present CoDeepNEAT for the coevolution of topology, components, and hyperparameters of architectures for CIFAR-10",CIFAR-10
Genetic CNN,"They evolve just the architecture of CNN on MNIST and CIFAR-10. They show interesting results, but note drawbacks. Their GA does not explore non-convolutional modules like Maxout nor multi-scale models like inception. They note that evolving the weights (to train) and hyperparameters (to tune) alongside the architectures shows interest as a future research direction. This leads into the future work of a different research group in presenting CoDeepNEAT, which accomplishes this end","MNIST, CIFAR-10, ILSVRC2012"
