# Proposal

## Directions

Propose your project topic

-   encouraged to talk to classmates / TA / instructor
-   form groups of 2-3
-   deliverables: Proposal (**max** 1-page PDF)
	1.  What is the problem you will be investigating? Why is it interesting?
	1.  What data will you use?
	1.  What method or algorithm are you proposing / modifying from?
	1.  What reading will you examine to provide context and background?
	1.  How will you evaluate your results?

## Outline

-   title: TODO
-   _What is the problem you will be investigating?_
	-   optimization of deep CNN **weights**, **hyperparameters**, and
		**architectures**.
	-   _why is it interesting?_
		-   Integrating other biologically inspired technology like evolutionary
			computation to evolve the predictive "brain" of a reinforcement
			learning agent allows the model to grow and shrink dynamically.
			In a technological sense, this is interesting because can apply this
			technology to find _optimal models_, an otherwise manual task for a
			data-scientist.
-   _What method or algorithm are you proposing / modifying from?_
	-   optimization and search algorithms for optimal models for value
		function prediction in reinforcement learning.
-   _What reading will you examine to provide context and background?_
	-   TODO: citations
-   _How will you evaluate your results?_
	-   we will benchmark our optimization technique against existing state
		of the art standards on a set of games provided through Open.ai gym.
		-   Deep Q Network
