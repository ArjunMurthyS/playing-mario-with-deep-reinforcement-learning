# Problem Statement

Recent papers by researchers at Uber AI Labs show the efficacy of evolutionary
algorithms in optimizing weights for _deep neural networks_ (DNN) on
image-based _reinforcement learning_ (RL) tasks. Although they achieve
state-of-the-art performance on multiple RL benchmarks, their work raises new
questions about the potential of evolutionary algorithms in deep RL. This
project aims to explore these questions by investigating the effect of
different kinds of genetic algorithms (GA) on the DNN weight problem space.
The Uber AI Labs researchers note the simplicity of their GA and the potential
of other GAs in optimizing DNN weights and suggest the introduction of a
crossover operator between candidate solutions in addition to pure Gaussian
mutation. Should time (and possibility) permit, we think evolving not only
network weights, but also _topologies_, _components_, and _hyperparameters_
would prove an interesting experiment. Such a full featured GA would mark the
beginning of entirely automated agent whose capacity can adapt to tasks
dynamically. We note that such a task encompasses new challenges, and as such,
may be infeasible for a term project. In either case, this work is interesting
as it explores modern topics of deep RL, the possibilities of modern hardware,
and the newfound potential of age-old GA research.
